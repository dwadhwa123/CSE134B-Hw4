          <dt>Business Game with <cite><a href="https://www.ceregem.net/blog" target="_blank" title="Ceregem Technologies Website">Ceregem Technologies</a></cite></dt>
            <dd><strong>Summary:</strong> I worked with two professors to create a real time game using <span class="programming-skill">JavaFX</span> for the UI components that allows players to make business decisions such as cost choices and advertising and gives out profits, sales using a formula.
              I managed my source control with Git. For example, I use: 
              <kbd><code>git status</code></kbd> to check the status of my repository.
              <kbd><code>git commit -m "Your commit message"</code></kbd> to commit changes to the repository.
              In order to quickly update the results based on the decisions made by the players, I stored the decisions in <dfn><span class="programming-skill">MongoDB</span></dfn>, which is a database that can store data in a document oriented format and used listeners to see when they were changed. 
              Using these listners, I could instantaneously update the UI. The reason I used MongoDB is because the information sent between users is fixed into a few decisions so there was no need to overcomplicate it by doing a client-server application.

          <dt>Pantry Pal</dt>
            <dd><strong>Summary:</strong> I worked with a group of 6 people to create a recipe generating and storing application. We used the <span class="programming-skill">Whisper API</span> to take in speech input of ingredients, then using those ingredients
              generating a recipe with a <span class="programming-skill">Chatgpt API</span>. Along with the recipe, we used the <span class="programming-skill">Dalle API</span> to generate images. Same as the game I created, we also used JavaFX for the UI. Finally, we also used a MongoDB server in order to save information from accounts so that you can log into an account from any device. 
              Working on this project helped improve my communication and teamwork as it forced me to compromise and make decisions that everyone could get behind.

          <dt>TFIDF Vectorizer to predict MBTI type</dt>
            <dd><strong>Summary:</strong> I created a <span class="programming-skill">TDIDF Vectorizer</span> with the purpose of taking in strings 
              representing the post history of the user and using that to predict the <abbr title="Myers Brigss Type Indicator">MBTI</abbr> of that user. I used supervised learning to train the model as the code shows below. 
            
              <pre>
                tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_features=5000)
    
                # Fit and transform the training data, and transform the test data
                X_train_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
                X_test_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.transform(X_test)
                log_reg = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
    
                # Train the model
                log_reg.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)
              </pre>
            </dd>


          <dt>Creating a custom NFA </dt>
          <dd><strong>Summary:</strong> I created a <abbr title="NonDeterminisitc Finite Automatic"><span class="programming-skill">NFA</span></abbr> which took in an input of a string and returned the string + 'ab' if of even length or the string minus its last character if of odd length.
            I really struggled with this project because it was very open ended in terms of the coding aspect and I wans't sure how I wanted to approach it. I thought about making classes/objects to represent the different states but ultimately decided on using boolean values.
            Even though it wasn't the most difficult project, it really helped refine my process in terms of how to approach a new problem that I haven't faced before.
